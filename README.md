># Professional-Branding-CV-Creation-

When I first started working on my CV, I wasnâ€™t entirely sure where to begin. I spent time exploring different formats, reading guides, and studying examples to understand what made a strong resume. Along the way, I learned the importance of tailoring my experiences to highlight relevant skills, keeping the layout clean, and presenting myself clearly. With practice and feedback from our lecturers, I gained confidence in crafting a professional CV that truly represents my abilities and aspirations.

Please see my CV attached in the readme files.
